// EXEC THIS MANUALLY, DO NOT EXEC THE BASE.CFG

sm plugins unload disabled/tf2Halftime // unloads tf2Halftime plugin as the config manages things just fine
sm plugins load disabled/roundtimer_override   // loads roundtimer_override
sm plugins load roundtimer_override    // loads roundtimer_override

// exec "rgl_6s_base"                  // don't need to exec base cfg again, teams don't typically changelevel after 1st/2nd half anyway

servercfgfile "rgl_6s_5cp_gc"          // sets server cfg to this config so that it gets autoexeced on level change (if that happens)

mp_winlimit "1"                        // sets number of wins to win the match to 1

say "RGL 6s GOLDEN CAP 5cp Config Executed."
say "First team to cap the other's last point wins the match. There is no time limit."
