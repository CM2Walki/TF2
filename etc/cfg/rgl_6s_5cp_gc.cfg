// EXEC THIS MANUALLY, DO NOT EXEC THE BASE.CFG

sm plugins unload disabled/tf2Halftime // unloads tf2Halftime plugin as the config manages things just fine

// exec "rgl_6s_base"                  // don't need to exec base cfg again, teams don't typically changelevel after 1st/2nd half anyway

servercfgfile "rgl_6s_5cp_gc"        // sets server cfg to this config so that it gets autoexeced on level change (if that happens)

mp_timelimit "0"                       // unsets server timelimit
mp_winlimit "1"                        // sets number of wins to win the match to 1
mp_windifference "0"                   // unsets windifference
mp_maxrounds "0"                       // unsets maxrounds
