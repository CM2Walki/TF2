//tv_maxclients "5"                         // source tv max clients. set it to something reasonable. default is most likely fine!!
// tv_autorecord 1                        // remove the two slashes at the very beginning of this line if you use a sourcemod plugin to autorecord stvs.

// hostname "RGL Fours PASS Time Match"             // server name in server browser. change this if you want
// tv_name "RGL 4s PASS Time Match (STV)"        // stv name in scoreboard and stv name in stv server browser
// tv_port "27020"                        // STV port, uncomment and change it if you need to

// sv_password "changeme"                 // server password. uncomment and set to whatever you want to have a custom password only for competitive matches >>>passwords are required for matches<<<
// tv_password "changeme"                 // STV password, uncomment and set to whatever you want so randoms can't join your STV without a password
