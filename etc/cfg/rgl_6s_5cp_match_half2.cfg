// 5cp Match (2nd Half) config for RGL 6s
// Config originally created May 11, 2019 -- Updated February 4th, 2019
// EXEC THIS MANUALLY, DO NOT EXEC THE BASE.CFG

// exec "rgl_6s_base"                  // don't need to exec base cfg again, teams don't typically changelevel after 1st half anyway

servercfgfile "rgl_6s_5cp_match_half2" // sets server cfg to this config so that it gets autoexeced on level change

mp_timelimit "30"                      // sets server timelimit to 30 minutes
mp_winlimit "5"                        // sets number of wins to win each half to 3
mp_windifference "0"                   // unsets windifference
mp_maxrounds "0"                       // unsets maxrounds

mp_tournament_restart                  // restarts the tournament to apply above settings (this is only in here as a kludge because most teams reexec this cfg to end their games instead of rgl_off)
